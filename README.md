# Mirinae

This is a game engine project powered by Vulkan.

Actually this is my third game engine project.
I stopped working on [Little-Ruler] because I felt had enough of OpenGL and wanted to try Vulkan.
The Vulkan project called [Dalbaragi] was pretty decent I guess.
But stopped this one as well when I graduated univ and started to find a job.
Years later, I found the code smells bad and I wanted to apply all my skills I've learnt so far.

So here I start a yet another game engine project!
Not sure how long I'll be working on this one.
But this time I'll do everything really carefully so it can grow larger and larger without overwelming my congnitive load limits.
